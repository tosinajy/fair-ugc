        <p class="ui text large">
            It started in a coffee shop in Atlanta, Georgia.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm <strong>Ajayi Oluwatosin</strong>, a web developer and digital enthusiast. I have a circle of incredibly talented friends here in Atlanta—photographers, video editors, and UGC creators—who constantly produce amazing work for brands.
        </p>
        <p>
            But I noticed a recurring problem. Despite their talent, they were constantly stressing over pricing.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Should I charge for usage rights?" <br>
            "Is $150 too much for a video?" <br>
            "How do I factor in paid ads?"
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            They were either undercharging significantly or losing clients because they couldn't justify their rates confidently. I got tired of seeing my friends—and creators like them—undervalued simply because the market data was opaque.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I built <strong>FairUGC</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to create a tool that strips away the guesswork. A calculator backed by real market data, standard industry multipliers, and clear usage rights logic. It's designed to give creators the confidence to say, <em>"This is my rate, and here is exactly why."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is for every creator in Atlanta and beyond who deserves to be paid fairly for their creativity.
